# i18next-example-typescript

In this example we are going to start form a simple login application and add multilanguage support.

Scenarios that we are going to cover:

- Translate markup text.
- Translate text generated by javascript.
- User interpolation.
- Split language resources in json files.
- Create namespaces to group translations like validation messages.

More samples coming soon:

- Use namespaces.

In the future we will incorporate more samples.

About folder structure:

- 00_start: Starting point (no multilanguage).

- 01_basic_translastion: application supporting mulilanguage (english / spanish).

- 02_change_language: added tu buttons to change the preffered language on the fly.

- 03_split_json: split local translation into separate json files and load
  them on demand.

- 04_namespaces: create namespaces to group translations like validation messages.

Each project (except 00 start) includes in its subfolder a Readme.md file with an step
by step guide to reproduce it.
