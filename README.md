# WIP

Editor to facilitate the translation of the local files of the different projects without coding. 

This would allow non-programmers (and programmers) to edit, modify and update different project translations more easily than editing long json files.

progress in: [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Gonzalo2310/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md)
